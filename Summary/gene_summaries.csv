ISG15,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Ubiquitin-like protein which plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection either via its conjugation to a target protein (ISGylation) or via its action as a free or unconjugated protein. ISGylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving E1, E2, and E3 enzymes which catalyze the conjugation of ISG15 to a lysine residue in the target protein (PubMed:33727702). Its target proteins include IFIT1, MX1/MxA, PPM1B, UBE2L6, UBA7, CHMP5, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and CHMP6. Isgylation of the viral sensor IFIH1/MDA5 promotes IFIH1/MDA5 oligomerization and triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses (PubMed:33727702). Can also isgylate: EIF2AK2/PKR which results in its activation, RIGI which inhibits its function in antiviral signaling response, EIF4E2 which enhances its cap structure-binding activity and translation-inhibition activity, UBE2N and UBE2E1 which negatively regulates their activity, IRF3 which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation and FLNB which prevents its ability to interact with the upstream activators of the JNK cascade thereby inhibiting IFNA-induced JNK signaling. Exhibits antiviral activity towards both DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1 and Ebola virus. Restricts HIV-1 and ebola virus via disruption of viral budding. Inhibits the ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and host TSG101 and disrupts their interaction, thereby preventing assembly and release of virions from infected cells. Inhibits Ebola virus budding mediated by the VP40 protein by disrupting ubiquitin ligase activity of NEDD4 and its ability to ubiquitinate VP40. ISGylates influenza A virus NS1 protein which causes a loss of function of the protein and the inhibition of virus replication. The secreted form of ISG15 can: induce natural killer cell proliferation, act as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils and act as a IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine playing an essential role in antimycobacterial immunity. The secreted form acts through the integrin ITGAL/ITGB2 receptor to initiate activation of SRC family tyrosine kinases including LYN, HCK and FGR which leads to secretion of IFNG and IL10; the interaction is mediated by ITGAL (PubMed:29100055).

[Isoform 1]: Heparan sulfate basal lamina glycoprotein that plays a central role in the formation and the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and directs key events in postsynaptic differentiation. Component of the AGRN-LRP4 receptor complex that induces the phosphorylation and activation of MUSK. The activation of MUSK in myotubes induces the formation of NMJ by regulating different processes including the transcription of specific genes and the clustering of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane. Calcium ions are required for maximal AChR clustering. AGRN function in neurons is highly regulated by alternative splicing, glycan binding and proteolytic processing. Modulates calcium ion homeostasis in neurons, specifically by inducing an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions. Functions differentially in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting the alpha(3)-subtype of Na+/K+-ATPase and evoking depolarization at CNS synapses. This secreted isoform forms a bridge, after release from motor neurons, to basal lamina through binding laminin via the NtA domain.

Calcium- and diacylglycerol-independent serine/threonine-protein kinase that functions in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, and is involved in NF-kappa-B activation, mitogenic signaling, cell proliferation, cell polarity, inflammatory response and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP). Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in macrophages, or following mitogenic stimuli, functions downstream of PI3K to activate MAP2K1/MEK1-MAPK1/ERK2 signaling cascade independently of RAF1 activation. Required for insulin-dependent activation of AKT3, but may function as an adapter rather than a direct activator. Upon insulin treatment may act as a downstream effector of PI3K and contribute to the activation of translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 and subsequent glucose transport in adipocytes. In EGF-induced cells, binds and activates MAP2K5/MEK5-MAPK7/ERK5 independently of its kinase activity and can activate JUN promoter through MEF2C. Through binding with SQSTM1/p62, functions in interleukin-1 signaling and activation of NF-kappa-B with the specific adapters RIPK1 and TRAF6. Participates in TNF-dependent transactivation of NF-kappa-B by phosphorylating and activating IKBKB kinase, which in turn leads to the degradation of NF-kappa-B inhibitors. In migrating astrocytes, forms a cytoplasmic complex with PARD6A and is recruited by CDC42 to function in the establishment of cell polarity along with the microtubule motor and dynein. In association with FEZ1, stimulates neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. In the inflammatory response, is required for the T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation process, including interleukin production, efficient activation of JAK1 and the subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6. May be involved in development of allergic airway inflammation (asthma), a process dependent on Th2 immune response. In the NF-kappa-B-mediated inflammatory response, can relieve SETD6-dependent repression of NF-kappa-B target genes by phosphorylating the RELA subunit at 'Ser-311'.

PER3,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Originally described as a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters. Can bind heme.

Multifunctional protein with controversial molecular function which plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress and cell death acting as oxidative stress sensor and redox-sensitive chaperone and protease (PubMed:17015834, 20304780, 18711745, 12796482, 19229105, 25416785, 26995087, 28993701). It is involved in neuroprotective mechanisms like the stabilization of NFE2L2 and PINK1 proteins, male fertility as a positive regulator of androgen signaling pathway as well as cell growth and transformation through, for instance, the modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway (PubMed:12612053, 15502874, 14749723, 17015834, 21097510, 18711745). Has been described as a protein and nucleotide deglycase that catalyzes the deglycation of the Maillard adducts formed between amino groups of proteins or nucleotides and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals (PubMed:25416785, 28596309). But this function is rebuted by other works (PubMed:27903648, 31653696). As a protein deglycase, repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage (PubMed:25416785, 28013050, 26995087). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair (PubMed:28596309). Protects histones from adduction by methylglyoxal, controls the levels of methylglyoxal-derived argininine modifications on chromatin (PubMed:30150385). Able to remove the glycations and restore histone 3, histone glycation disrupts both local and global chromatin architecture by altering histone-DNA interactions as well as histone acetylation and ubiquitination levels (PubMed:30150385, 30894531). Displays a very low glyoxalase activity that may reflect its deglycase activity (PubMed:22523093, 31653696, 28993701). Eliminates hydrogen peroxide and protects cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (PubMed:16390825). Required for correct mitochondrial morphology and function as well as for autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria (PubMed:19229105, 16632486). Plays a role in regulating expression or stability of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins SLC25A14 and SLC25A27 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and attenuates the oxidative stress induced by calcium entry into the neurons via L-type channels during pacemaking (PubMed:18711745). Regulates astrocyte inflammatory responses, may modulate lipid rafts-dependent endocytosis in astrocytes and neuronal cells (PubMed:23847046). In pancreatic islets, involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and glucose homeostasis in an age- and diet dependent manner. Protects pancreatic beta cells from cell death induced by inflammatory and cytotoxic setting (By similarity). Binds to a number of mRNAs containing multiple copies of GG or CC motifs and partially inhibits their translation but dissociates following oxidative stress (PubMed:18626009). Metal-binding protein able to bind copper as well as toxic mercury ions, enhances the cell protection mechanism against induced metal toxicity (PubMed:23792957). In macrophages, interacts with the NADPH oxidase subunit NCF1 to direct NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, and protects against sepsis (By similarity).

EXOSC10,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Putative catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex which has 3'->5' exoribonuclease activity and participates in a multitude of cellular RNA processing and degradation events. In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. It seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. EXOSC10 is required for nucleolar localization of C1D and probably mediates the association of MTREX, C1D and MPHOSPH6 with the RNA exosome involved in the maturation of 5.8S rRNA.

MTOR,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Serine/threonine protein kinase which is a central regulator of cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to hormones, growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals (PubMed:12087098, 12150925, 12150926, 12231510, 12718876, 14651849, 15268862, 15467718, 15545625, 15718470, 18497260, 18762023, 18925875, 20516213, 20537536, 21659604, 23429703, 23429704, 25799227, 26018084). MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, 15467718, 18925875, 18497260, 20516213, 21576368, 21659604, 23429704). Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, 12150925, 12150926, 12231510, 12718876, 14651849, 15268862, 15467718, 15545625, 15718470, 18497260, 18762023, 18925875, 20516213, 20537536, 21659604, 23429703, 23429704, 25799227, 26018084). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (By similarity). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12150925, 12087098, 18925875). This also includes mTORC1 signaling cascade controlling the MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3: in the presence of nutrients, mediates phosphorylation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22576015, 22343943, 22692423). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22576015, 22343943, 22692423). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429704, 23429703). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (By similarity). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). mTORC1 also negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (By similarity). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (By similarity). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, 25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). As part of the mTORC2 complex MTOR may regulate other cellular processes including survival and organization of the cytoskeleton (PubMed:15268862, 15467718). Plays a critical role in the phosphorylation at 'Ser-473' of AKT1, a pro-survival effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, facilitating its activation by PDK1 (PubMed:15718470). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity). Phosphorylates SQSTM1, promoting interaction between SQSTM1 and KEAP1 and subsequent inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex (By similarity). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768).

Mediates effects on cell migration and adhesion through its different partners. During development plays a role in blood and lymphatic vessels separation by binding CLEC1B, triggering CLEC1B activation in platelets and leading to platelet activation and/or aggregation (PubMed:14522983, 15231832, 17616532, 18215137, 17222411). Interaction with CD9, on the contrary, attenuates platelet aggregation induced by PDPN (PubMed:18541721). Through MSN or EZR interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to ERZ phosphorylation and triggering RHOA activation leading to cell migration increase and invasiveness (PubMed:17046996, 21376833). Interaction with CD44 promotes directional cell migration in epithelial and tumor cells (PubMed:20962267). In lymph nodes (LNs), controls fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and contraction of the actomyosin by maintaining ERM proteins (EZR; MSN and RDX) and MYL9 activation through association with unknown transmembrane proteins. Engagement of CLEC1B by PDPN promotes FRCs relaxation by blocking lateral membrane interactions leading to reduction of ERM proteins (EZR; MSN and RDX) and MYL9 activation (By similarity). Through binding with LGALS8 may participate in connection of the lymphatic endothelium to the surrounding extracellular matrix (PubMed:19268462). In keratinocytes, induces changes in cell morphology showing an elongated shape, numerous membrane protrusions, major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, increased motility and decreased cell adhesion (PubMed:15515019). Controls invadopodia stability and maturation leading to efficient degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor cells through modulation of RHOC activity in order to activate ROCK1/ROCK2 and LIMK1/LIMK2 and inactivation of CFL1 (PubMed:25486435). Required for normal lung cell proliferation and alveolus formation at birth (By similarity). Does not function as a water channel or as a regulator of aquaporin-type water channels (PubMed:9651190).

Citrullinates histone H1 at 'Arg-54' (to form H1R54ci), histone H3 at 'Arg-2', 'Arg-8', 'Arg-17' and/or 'Arg-26' (to form H3R2ci, H3R8ci, H3R17ci, H3R26ci, respectively) and histone H4 at 'Arg-3' (to form H4R3ci) (PubMed:15339660, 15345777, 16567635, 21245532). Acts as a key regulator of stem cell maintenance by mediating citrullination of histone H1: citrullination of 'Arg-54' of histone H1 (H1R54ci) results in H1 displacement from chromatin and global chromatin decondensation, thereby promoting pluripotency and stem cell maintenance (PubMed:15339660, 15345777, 16567635, 21245532). Promotes profound chromatin decondensation during the innate immune response to infection in neutrophils by mediating formation of H1R54ci (PubMed:18209087). Required for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); NETs are mainly composed of DNA fibers and are released by neutrophils to bind pathogens during inflammation (By similarity). Citrullination of histone H3 prevents their methylation by CARM1 and HRMT1L2/PRMT1 and represses transcription (PubMed:15345777).

PINK1,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Serine/threonine-protein kinase which protects against mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress by phosphorylating mitochondrial proteins such as PRKN and DNM1L, to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:14607334, 18957282, 18443288, 15087508, 19229105, 19966284, 20404107, 22396657, 20798600, 23620051, 23754282, 23933751, 24660806, 24898855, 24751536, 24784582, 24896179, 25527291, 32484300, 20547144). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage and/or dysfunction, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to regulating mitochondrial dynamics and eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via mitophagy (PubMed:18443288, 23620051, 24898855, 20798600, 20404107, 19966284, 32484300, 22396657, 32047033, 15087508). Mediates the translocation and activation of PRKN at the outer membrane (OMM) of dysfunctional/depolarized mitochondria (PubMed:19966284, 20404107, 20798600, 23754282, 24660806, 24751536, 24784582, 25474007, 25527291). At the OMM of damaged mitochondria, phosphorylates pre-existing polyubiquitin chains at 'Ser-65', the PINK1-phosphorylated polyubiquitin then recruits PRKN from the cytosol to the OMM where PRKN is fully activated by phosphorylation at 'Ser-65' by PINK1 (PubMed:19966284, 20404107, 20798600, 23754282, 24660806, 24751536, 24784582, 25474007, 25527291). In damaged mitochondria, mediates the decision between mitophagy or preventing apoptosis by promoting PRKN-dependent poly- or monoubiquitination of VDAC1; polyubiquitination of VDAC1 by PRKN promotes mitophagy, while monoubiquitination of VDAC1 by PRKN decreases mitochondrial calcium influx which ultimately inhibits apoptosis (PubMed:32047033). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, functions with PRKN to promote clearance of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) (PubMed:14607334, 20798600, 20404107, 19966284, 23933751, 15087508). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria by phosphorylating and thus promoting the PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:18443288, 23620051, 24898855). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:18443288, 23620051). Also promotes mitochondrial fission independently of PRKN and ATG7-mediated mitophagy, via the phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L (PubMed:18443288, 32484300). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Required for ubiquinone reduction by mitochondrial complex I by mediating phosphorylation of complex I subunit NDUFA10 (By similarity). Phosphorylates LETM1, positively regulating its mitochondrial calcium transport activity (PubMed:29123128).

Alkaline phosphatase that metabolizes various phosphate compounds and plays a key role in skeletal mineralization and adaptive thermogenesis (PubMed:12162492, 23688511, 25982064). Has broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze a considerable variety of compounds: however, only a few substrates, such as diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate; PPi), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and N-phosphocreatine are natural substrates (PubMed:12162492, 2220817). Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration (PubMed:23688511, 25982064). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Also promotes dephosphorylation of osteopontin (SSP1), an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization in its phosphorylated state; it is however unclear whether ALPL/TNAP mediates SSP1 dephosphorylation via a direct or indirect manner (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PLP to pyridoxal (PL), the transportable form of vitamin B6, in order to provide a sufficient amount of PLP in the brain, an essential cofactor for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of diverse neurotransmitters (PubMed:2220817, 20049532). Additionally, also able to mediate ATP degradation in a stepwise manner to adenosine, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for purinergic receptors (By similarity). Also capable of dephosphorylating microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as other phosphorylated small-molecules, such as poly-inosine:cytosine (poly I:C) (PubMed:28448526). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating hydrolysis of N-phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity).

Histone demethylase that can demethylate both 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-9' (H3K9me) of histone H3, thereby acting as a coactivator or a corepressor, depending on the context (PubMed:15620353, 15811342, 16140033, 16079794, 16079795, 16223729). Acts by oxidizing the substrate by FAD to generate the corresponding imine that is subsequently hydrolyzed (PubMed:15620353, 15811342, 16079794, 21300290). Acts as a corepressor by mediating demethylation of H3K4me, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. Demethylates both mono- (H3K4me1) and di-methylated (H3K4me2) H3K4me (PubMed:15620353, 20389281, 21300290, 23721412). May play a role in the repression of neuronal genes. Alone, it is unable to demethylate H3K4me on nucleosomes and requires the presence of RCOR1/CoREST to achieve such activity (PubMed:16140033, 16079794, 16885027, 21300290, 23721412). Also acts as a coactivator of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription, by being recruited to AR target genes and mediating demethylation of H3K9me, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. The presence of PRKCB in AR-containing complexes, which mediates phosphorylation of 'Thr-6' of histone H3 (H3T6ph), a specific tag that prevents demethylation H3K4me, prevents H3K4me demethylase activity of KDM1A (PubMed:16079795). Demethylates di-methylated 'Lys-370' of p53/TP53 which prevents interaction of p53/TP53 with TP53BP1 and represses p53/TP53-mediated transcriptional activation. Demethylates and stabilizes the DNA methylase DNMT1 (PubMed:29691401). Demethylates methylated 'Lys-42' and methylated 'Lys-117' of SOX2 (PubMed:29358331).

Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:32669547, 19191325). The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (PubMed:32669547, 19191325). The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain (PubMed:32669547, 19191325). The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel (PubMed:32669547, 19191325). As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:19061985, 12962325, 24120868).

SELENON,NCBI Gene Summary,"This gene encodes a glycoprotein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress, and in the regulation of redox-related calcium homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with early onset muscle disorders, referred to as SEPN1-related myopathy. SEPN1-related myopathy consists of 4 autosomal recessive disorders, originally thought to be separate entities: rigid spine muscular dystrophy (RSMD1), the classical form of multiminicore disease, desmin related myopathy with Mallory-body like inclusions, and congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD). This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. A second stop-codon redefinition element (SRE) adjacent to the UGA codon has been identified in this gene (PMID:15791204). SRE is a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure that stimulates readthrough at the UGA codon, and augments the Sec insertion efficiency by SECIS. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]"

SELENON,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
[Isoform 2]: Plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress and in the regulation of redox-related calcium homeostasis. Regulates the calcium level of the ER by protecting the calcium pump ATP2A2 against the oxidoreductase ERO1A-mediated oxidative damage. Within the ER, ERO1A activity increases the concentration of H(2)O(2), which attacks the luminal thiols in ATP2A2 and thus leads to cysteinyl sulfenic acid formation (-SOH) and SEPN1 reduces the SOH back to free thiol (-SH), thus restoring ATP2A2 activity (PubMed:25452428). Acts as a modulator of ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity: protects RyR from oxidation due to increased oxidative stress, or directly controls the RyR redox state, regulating the RyR-mediated calcium mobilization required for normal muscle development and differentiation (PubMed:19557870, 18713863).

RNA-binding protein that inhibits processing of pre-let-7 miRNAs and regulates translation of mRNAs that control developmental timing, pluripotency and metabolism (PubMed:21247876). Seems to recognize a common structural G-quartet (G4) feature in its miRNA and mRNA targets (Probable). 'Translational enhancer' that drives specific mRNAs to polysomes and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis. Its association with the translational machinery and target mRNAs results in an increased number of initiation events per molecule of mRNA and, indirectly, in mRNA stabilization. Binds IGF2 mRNA, MYOD1 mRNA, ARBP/36B4 ribosomal protein mRNA and its own mRNA. Essential for skeletal muscle differentiation program through the translational up-regulation of IGF2 expression. Suppressor of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, including that of let-7, miR107, miR-143 and miR-200c. Specifically binds the miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs), recognizing an 5'-GGAG-3' motif found in pre-miRNA terminal loop, and recruits TUT4 and TUT7 uridylyltransferases (PubMed:18951094, 19703396, 22118463, 22898984). This results in the terminal uridylation of target pre-miRNAs (PubMed:18951094, 19703396, 22118463, 22898984). Uridylated pre-miRNAs fail to be processed by Dicer and undergo degradation. The repression of let-7 expression is required for normal development and contributes to maintain the pluripotent state by preventing let-7-mediated differentiation of embryonic stem cells (PubMed:18951094, 19703396, 22118463, 22898984). Localized to the periendoplasmic reticulum area, binds to a large number of spliced mRNAs and inhibits the translation of mRNAs destined for the ER, reducing the synthesis of transmembrane proteins, ER or Golgi lumen proteins, and secretory proteins.

Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts downstream of ERK (MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1) signaling and mediates mitogenic and stress-induced activation of the transcription factors CREB1, ETV1/ER81 and NR4A1/NUR77, regulates translation through RPS6 and EIF4B phosphorylation, and mediates cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation by modulating mTOR signaling and repressing pro-apoptotic function of BAD and DAPK1. In fibroblast, is required for EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB1, which results in the subsequent transcriptional activation of several immediate-early genes. In response to mitogenic stimulation (EGF and PMA), phosphorylates and activates NR4A1/NUR77 and ETV1/ER81 transcription factors and the cofactor CREBBP. Upon insulin-derived signal, acts indirectly on the transcription regulation of several genes by phosphorylating GSK3B at 'Ser-9' and inhibiting its activity. Phosphorylates RPS6 in response to serum or EGF via an mTOR-independent mechanism and promotes translation initiation by facilitating assembly of the pre-initiation complex. In response to insulin, phosphorylates EIF4B, enhancing EIF4B affinity for the EIF3 complex and stimulating cap-dependent translation. Is involved in the mTOR nutrient-sensing pathway by directly phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-1798', which potently inhibits TSC2 ability to suppress mTOR signaling, and mediates phosphorylation of RPTOR, which regulates mTORC1 activity and may promote rapamycin-sensitive signaling independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD and DAPK1 and suppressing their pro-apoptotic function. Promotes the survival of hepatic stellate cells by phosphorylating CEBPB in response to the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Mediates induction of hepatocyte prolifration by TGFA through phosphorylation of CEBPB (By similarity). Is involved in cell cycle regulation by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitor CDKN1B, which promotes CDKN1B association with 14-3-3 proteins and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and inhibition of G1 progression.

The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. It possesses at least two conserved domains that could be important for its function. First, it has a DNA-binding domain that can specifically bind an AT-rich DNA sequence known to be recognized by a SNF/SWI complex at the beta-globin locus. Second, the C-terminus of the protein can stimulate glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional activation. It is thought that the protein encoded by this gene confers specificity to the SNF/SWI complex and may recruit the complex to its targets through either protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions.

Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Binds DNA non-specifically. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity).

YTHDF2,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Specifically recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, and regulates their stability (PubMed:24284625, 26046440, 26318451, 32492408). M6A is a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs and plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:22575960, 24284625, 32492408, 25412658, 25412661). Acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT and ribonuclease P/MRP complexes, depending on the context (PubMed:24284625, 26046440, 27558897, 30930054, 32492408). The YTHDF paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) share m6A-containing mRNAs targets and act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation (PubMed:28106072, 32492408). M6A-containing mRNAs containing a binding site for RIDA/HRSP12 (5'-GGUUC-3') are preferentially degraded by endoribonucleolytic cleavage: cooperative binding of RIDA/HRSP12 and YTHDF2 to transcripts leads to recruitment of the ribonuclease P/MRP complex (PubMed:30930054). Other m6A-containing mRNAs undergo deadenylation via direct interaction between YTHDF2 and CNOT1, leading to recruitment of the CCR4-NOT and subsequent deadenylation of m6A-containing mRNAs (PubMed:27558897). Required maternally to regulate oocyte maturation: probably acts by binding to m6A-containing mRNAs, thereby regulating maternal transcript dosage during oocyte maturation, which is essential for the competence of oocytes to sustain early zygotic development (By similarity). Also required during spermatogenesis: regulates spermagonial adhesion by promoting degradation of m6A-containing transcripts coding for matrix metallopeptidases (By similarity). Also involved in hematopoietic stem cells specification by binding to m6A-containing mRNAs, leading to promote their degradation (PubMed:30065315). Also acts as a regulator of neural development by promoting m6A-dependent degradation of neural development-related mRNA targets (By similarity). Inhibits neural specification of induced pluripotent stem cells by binding to methylated neural-specific mRNAs and promoting their degradation, thereby restraining neural differentiation (PubMed:32169943). Regulates circadian regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism: acts by promoting m6A-dependent degradation of PPARA transcripts (PubMed:30428350). Regulates the innate immune response to infection by inhibiting the type I interferon response: acts by binding to m6A-containing IFNB transcripts and promoting their degradation (PubMed:30559377). May also act as a promoter of cap-independent mRNA translation following heat shock stress: upon stress, relocalizes to the nucleus and specifically binds mRNAs with some m6A methylation mark at their 5'-UTR, protecting demethylation of mRNAs by FTO, thereby promoting cap-independent mRNA translation (PubMed:26458103). Regulates mitotic entry by promoting the phase-specific m6A-dependent degradation of WEE1 transcripts (PubMed:32267835). Promotes formation of phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies or stress granules, by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to mRNAs containing multiple m6A-modified residues: polymethylated mRNAs act as a multivalent scaffold for the binding of YTHDF proteins, juxtaposing their disordered regions and thereby leading to phase separation (PubMed:31388144, 31292544, 32451507, 31642031). The resulting mRNA-YTHDF complexes then partition into different endogenous phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies, stress granules or neuronal RNA granules (PubMed:31292544). May also recognize and bind RNAs modified by C5-methylcytosine (m5C) and act as a regulator of rRNA processing (PubMed:31815440).

Mediates post-transcriptional repression of transcripts via different mechanisms: acts via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation (PubMed:22955276). Also mediates deadenylation-independent repression by promoting accessibility of miRNAs (PubMed:18776931, 20818387, 20860814, 22345517). Following growth factor stimulation, phosphorylated and binds to the 3'-UTR of CDKN1B/p27 mRNA, inducing a local conformational change that exposes miRNA-binding sites, promoting association of miR-221 and miR-222, efficient suppression of CDKN1B/p27 expression, and rapid entry to the cell cycle (PubMed:20818387). Acts as a post-transcriptional repressor of E2F3 mRNAs by binding to its 3'-UTR and facilitating miRNA regulation (PubMed:22345517, 29474920). Represses a program of genes necessary to maintain genomic stability such as key mitotic, DNA repair and DNA replication factors. Its ability to repress those target mRNAs is regulated by the lncRNA NORAD (non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage) which, due to its high abundance and multitude of PUMILIO binding sites, is able to sequester a significant fraction of PUM1 and PUM2 in the cytoplasm (PubMed:26724866).

Calcium-binding protein that acts as an adapter that bridges unrelated proteins or stabilizes weak protein-protein complexes in response to calcium.

In response to cytosolic calcium increase, the heterodimer formed with PDCD6 interacts with, and bridges together the BCR(KLHL12) complex and SEC31 (SEC31A or SEC31B), promoting monoubiquitination of SEC31 and subsequent collagen export, which is required for neural crest specification (PubMed:27716508). Its role in the heterodimer formed with PDCD6 is however unclear: some evidence shows that PEF1 and PDCD6 work together and promote association between PDCD6 and SEC31 in presence of calcium (PubMed:27716508). Other reports show that PEF1 dissociates from PDCD6 in presence of calcium, and may act as a negative regulator of PDCD6 (PubMed:11278427).

At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays an essential role in the selection and maturation of developing T-cells in the thymus and in the function of mature T-cells. Plays a key role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-linked signal transduction pathways. Constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD4 and CD8 surface receptors. Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby recruiting the associated LCK protein to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-gamma chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. Once stimulated, the TCR recruits the tyrosine kinase ZAP70, that becomes phosphorylated and activated by LCK. Following this, a large number of signaling molecules are recruited, ultimately leading to lymphokine production. LCK also contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. Associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, which leads to hyperphosphorylation and activation of LCK. Also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK. Is expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and is required for the regulation of maturation events that are governed by both pre-TCR and mature alpha beta TCR. Phosphorylates other substrates including RUNX3, PTK2B/PYK2, the microtubule-associated protein MAPT, RHOH or TYROBP. Interacts with FYB2 (PubMed:27335501).

AZIN2,NCBI Gene Summary,"The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the antizyme inhibitor family, which plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by maintaining polyamine homeostasis within the cell. Antizyme inhibitors are homologs of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) that have lost the ability to decarboxylase ornithine; however, retain the ability to bind to antizymes. Antizymes negatively regulate intracellular polyamine levels by binding to ODC and targeting it for degradation, as well as by inhibiting polyamine uptake. Antizyme inhibitors function as positive regulators of polyamine levels by sequestering antizymes and neutralizing their effect. This gene encodes antizyme inhibitor 2, the second member of this gene family. Like antizyme inhibitor 1, antizyme inhibitor 2 interacts with all 3 antizymes and stimulates ODC activity and polyamine uptake. However, unlike antizyme inhibitor 1, which is ubiquitously expressed and localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, antizyme inhibitor 2 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis and localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment. Recent studies indicate that antizyme inhibitor 2 is also expressed in specific cell types in ovaries, adrenal glands and pancreas, and in mast cells. The exact function of this gene is not known, however, available data suggest its role in cell growth, spermiogenesis, vesicular trafficking and secretion. Accumulation of antizyme inhibitor 2 has also been observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. There has been confusion in literature and databases over the nomenclature of this gene, stemming from an earlier report that a human cDNA clone (identical to ODCp/AZIN2) had arginine decarboxylase (ADC) activity (PMID:14738999). Subsequent studies in human and mouse showed that antizyme inhibitor 2 was devoid of arginine decarboxylase activity (PMID:19956990).

SFPQ,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
DNA- and RNA binding protein, involved in several nuclear processes. Essential pre-mRNA splicing factor required early in spliceosome formation and for splicing catalytic step II, probably as a heteromer with NONO. Binds to pre-mRNA in spliceosome C complex, and specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts. Involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing. During splicing of PTPRC/CD45, a phosphorylated form is sequestered by THRAP3 from the pre-mRNA in resting T-cells; T-cell activation and subsequent reduced phosphorylation is proposed to lead to release from THRAP3 allowing binding to pre-mRNA splicing regulatotry elements which represses exon inclusion. Interacts with U5 snRNA, probably by binding to a purine-rich sequence located on the 3' side of U5 snRNA stem 1b. May be involved in a pre-mRNA coupled splicing and polyadenylation process as component of a snRNP-free complex with SNRPA/U1A. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs. SFPQ may be involved in homologous DNA pairing; in vitro, promotes the invasion of ssDNA between a duplex DNA and produces a D-loop formation. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA unwinding by modulating the function of topoisomerase I/TOP1; in vitro, stimulates dissociation of TOP1 from DNA after cleavage and enhances its jumping between separate DNA helices. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer binds DNA (PubMed:25765647). The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination and may stabilize paired DNA ends; in vitro, the complex strongly stimulates DNA end joining, binds directly to the DNA substrates and cooperates with the Ku70/G22P1-Ku80/XRCC5 (Ku) dimer to establish a functional preligation complex. SFPQ is involved in transcriptional regulation. Functions as transcriptional activator (PubMed:25765647). Transcriptional repression is mediated by an interaction of SFPQ with SIN3A and subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional activity. SFPQ isoform Long binds to the DNA binding domains (DBD) of nuclear hormone receptors, like RXRA and probably THRA, and acts as transcriptional corepressor in absence of hormone ligands. Binds the DNA sequence 5'-CTGAGTC-3' in the insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE) and inhibits IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer. Required for the transcriptional repression of circadian target genes, such as PER1, mediated by the large PER complex through histone deacetylation (By similarity). Required for the assembly of nuclear speckles (PubMed:25765647). Plays a role in the regulation of DNA virus-mediated innate immune response by assembling into the HDP-RNP complex, a complex that serves as a platform for IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent innate immune response activation through the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:28712728).

PSMB2,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Non-catalytic component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins.

The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex).

MRPS15,NCBI Gene Summary,"Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S15P family. The encoded protein is more than two times the size of its E. coli counterpart, with the 12S rRNA binding sites conserved. Between human and mouse, the encoded protein is the least conserved among small subunit ribosomal proteins. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 15q and 19q.

ZC3H12A,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Endoribonuclease involved in various biological functions such as cellular inflammatory response and immune homeostasis, glial differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells, cell death of cardiomyocytes, adipogenesis and angiogenesis. Functions as an endoribonuclease involved in mRNA decay (PubMed:19909337). Modulates the inflammatory response by promoting the degradation of a set of translationally active cytokine-induced inflammation-related mRNAs, such as IL6 and IL12B, during the early phase of inflammation (PubMed:26320658). Prevents aberrant T-cell-mediated immune reaction by degradation of multiple mRNAs controlling T-cell activation, such as those encoding cytokines (IL6 and IL2), cell surface receptors (ICOS, TNFRSF4 and TNFR2) and transcription factor (REL) (By similarity). Inhibits cooperatively with ZC3H12A the differentiation of helper T cells Th17 in lungs. They repress target mRNA encoding the Th17 cell-promoting factors IL6, ICOS, REL, IRF4, NFKBID and NFKBIZ. The cooperation requires RNA-binding by RC3H1 and the nuclease activity of ZC3H12A (By similarity). Together with RC3H1, destabilizes TNFRSF4/OX40 mRNA by binding to the conserved stem loop structure in its 3'UTR (By similarity). Self regulates by destabilizing its own mRNA (By similarity). Cleaves mRNA harboring a stem-loop (SL), often located in their 3'-UTRs, during the early phase of inflammation in a helicase UPF1-dependent manner (PubMed:19909337, 26320658, 26134560, 22561375). Plays a role in the inhibition of microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis (PubMed:22055188). Cleaves the terminal loop of a set of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) important for the regulation of the inflammatory response leading to their degradation, and thus preventing the biosynthesis of mature miRNAs (PubMed:22055188). Also plays a role in promoting angiogenesis in response to inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the production of antiangiogenic microRNAs via its anti-dicer RNase activity (PubMed:24048733). Affects the overall ubiquitination of cellular proteins (By similarity). Positively regulates deubiquitinase activity promoting the cleavage at 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), preventing JNK and NF-kappa-B signaling pathway activation, and hence negatively regulating macrophage-mediated inflammatory response and immune homeostasis (By similarity). Induces also deubiquitination of the transcription factor HIF1A, probably leading to its stabilization and nuclear import, thereby positively regulating the expression of proangiogenic HIF1A-targeted genes (PubMed:24048733). Involved in a TANK-dependent negative feedback response to attenuate NF-kappaB activation through the deubiquitination of IKBKG or TRAF6 in response to interleukin-1-beta (IL1B) stimulation or upon DNA damage (PubMed:25861989). Prevents stress granule (SGs) formation and promotes macrophage apoptosis under stress conditions, including arsenite-induced oxidative stress, heat shock and energy deprivation (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of macrophage polarization; promotes IL4-induced polarization of macrophages M1 into anti-inflammatory M2 state (By similarity). May also act as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in inflammatory response, angiogenesis, adipogenesis and apoptosis (PubMed:16574901, 18364357). Functions as a positive regulator of glial differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells through an amyloid precursor protein (APP)-dependent signaling pathway (PubMed:19185603). Attenuates septic myocardial contractile dysfunction in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by reducing I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation, and hence myocardial pro-inflammatory cytokine production (By similarity).

Functions in nuclear protein import as nuclear transport receptor. Serves as receptor for nuclear localization signals (NLS) in cargo substrates. Is thought to mediate docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through binding to nucleoporin and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to the importin, the importin/substrate complex dissociates and importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus (By similarity). Mediates the nuclear import of UBC9, the RBM8A/MAGOH complex, PAX6 and probably other members of the paired homeobox family. Also mediates nuclear export of eIF-1A, and the cytoplasmic release of eIF-1A is triggered by the loading of import substrates onto IPO13.

Cyanocobalamin constitutes the inactive form of vitamin B12 introduced from the diet, and is converted into the active cofactors methylcobalamin (MeCbl) involved in methionine biosynthesis, and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) involved in the TCA cycle (PubMed:19801555). Forms a complex with the lysosomal transporter ABCD4 and its chaperone LMBRD1, to transport cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane into the cytosol (PubMed:25535791). The processing of cobalamin in the cytosol occurs in a multiprotein complex composed of at least MMACHC, MMADHC, MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) and MTR (methionine synthase) which may contribute to shuttle safely and efficiently cobalamin towards MTR in order to produce methionine (PubMed:21071249, 27771510). Also acts as a glutathione transferase by catalyzing the dealkylation of the alkylcob(III)alamins MeCbl and AdoCbl, using the thiolate of glutathione for nucleophilic displacement to generate cob(I)alamin and the corresponding glutathione thioether (PubMed:19801555, 21697092, 22642810, 25809485).

UQCRH,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, a multisubunit transmembrane complex that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. The cytochrome b-c1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this redox reaction to translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, with protons being carried across the membrane as hydrogens on the quinol. In the process called Q cycle, 2 protons are consumed from the matrix, 4 protons are released into the intermembrane space and 2 electrons are passed to cytochrome c.

Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:7679927, 1739747, 8914854, 10553002, 10660572, 15611369). Catalyzes predominantly the oxidation of the terminal carbon (omega-oxidation) of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, the catalytic efficiency decreasing in the following order: dodecanoic > tetradecanoic > (9Z)-octadecenoic > (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic > hexadecanoic acid (PubMed:10553002, 10660572). Acts as a major omega-hydroxylase for dodecanoic (lauric) acid in liver (PubMed:7679927, 1739747, 8914854, 15611369). Participates in omega-hydroxylation of (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (arachidonate) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a signaling molecule acting both as vasoconstrictive and natriuretic with overall effect on arterial blood pressure (PubMed:10620324, 10660572, 15611369). Can also catalyze the oxidation of the penultimate carbon (omega-1 oxidation) of fatty acids with lower efficiency (PubMed:7679927). May contribute to the degradation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) such as docosanoic acid, by catalyzing successive omega-oxidations to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid, thereby initiating chain shortening (PubMed:18182499). Omega-hydroxylates (9R,10S)-epoxy-octadecanoate stereoisomer (PubMed:15145985). Plays a minor role in omega-oxidation of long-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids (PubMed:18065749).

Plays a role in the regulation of mRNA stability, alternative splicing and translation (PubMed:7898713, 10710437, 12034726, 12468554, 17035636, 17234598). Binds to AU-rich element (ARE) sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, including GAP43, VEGF, FOS, CDKN1A and ACHE mRNA (PubMed:7898713, 10710437, 12034726, 12468554). Many of the target mRNAs are coding for RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors and proteins involved in RNA processing and/or neuronal development and function (By similarity). By binding to the mRNA 3'UTR, decreases mRNA deadenylation and thereby contributes to the stabilization of mRNA molecules and their protection from decay (PubMed:12034726). Also binds to the polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail in the 3'UTR of mRNA, thereby increasing its affinity for mRNA binding (PubMed:12034726). Mainly plays a role in neuron-specific RNA processing by stabilization of mRNAs such as GAP43, ACHE and mRNAs of other neuronal proteins, thereby contributing to the differentiation of neural progenitor cells, nervous system development, learning and memory mechanisms (PubMed:12034726, 12468554, 17234598, 18218628). Involved in the negative regulation of the proliferative activity of neuronal stem cells and in the positive regulation of neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells (By similarity).

TUT4,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Uridylyltransferase that mediates the terminal uridylation of mRNAs with short (less than 25 nucleotides) poly(A) tails, hence facilitating global mRNA decay (PubMed:25480299, 31036859). Essential for both oocyte maturation and fertility. Through 3' terminal uridylation of mRNA, sculpts, with TUT7, the maternal transcriptome by eliminating transcripts during oocyte growth (By similarity). Involved in microRNA (miRNA)-induced gene silencing through uridylation of deadenylated miRNA targets. Also functions as an integral regulator of microRNA biogenesis using 3 different uridylation mechanisms (PubMed:25979828). Acts as a suppressor of miRNA biogenesis by mediating the terminal uridylation of some miRNA precursors, including that of let-7 (pre-let-7), miR107, miR-143 and miR-200c. Uridylated miRNAs are not processed by Dicer and undergo degradation. Degradation of pre-let-7 contributes to the maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency (By similarity). Also catalyzes the 3' uridylation of miR-26A, a miRNA that targets IL6 transcript. This abrogates the silencing of IL6 transcript, hence promoting cytokine expression (PubMed:19703396). In the absence of LIN28A, TUT7 and TUT4 monouridylate group II pre-miRNAs, which includes most of pre-let7 members, that shapes an optimal 3' end overhang for efficient processing (PubMed:25979828). Adds oligo-U tails to truncated pre-miRNAS with a 5' overhang which may promote rapid degradation of non-functional pre-miRNA species (PubMed:25979828). May also suppress Toll-like receptor-induced NF-kappa-B activation via binding to T2BP (PubMed:16643855). Does not play a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation (PubMed:18172165). Due to functional redundancy between TUT4 and TUT7, the identification of the specific role of each of these proteins is difficult (PubMed:25979828, 25480299, 16643855, 19703396, 18172165) (By similarity). TUT4 and TUT7 restrict retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) in cooperation with MOV10 counteracting the RNA chaperonne activity of L1RE1. TUT7 uridylates LINE-1 mRNAs in the cytoplasm which inhibits initiation of reverse transcription once in the nucleus, whereas uridylation by TUT4 destabilizes mRNAs in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules (PubMed:30122351).

Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638). Plays a redundant role with MAGOHB as core component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (PubMed:23917022). The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM1 leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm and translation enhancement of EJC-bearing spliced mRNAs by recruiting them to the ribosomal 48S preinitiation complex. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the function is different from the established EJC assembly.

Acts in part as a hepatokine that is involved in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism (PubMed:11788823, 12909640, 23661675, 25495645). Proposed to play a role in the trafficking of energy substrates to either storage or oxidative tissues in response to food intake (By similarity). Has a stimulatory effect on plasma triglycerides (TG), which is achieved by suppressing plasma TG clearance via inhibition of LPL activity. The inhibition of LPL activity appears to be an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of proprotein convertases PCSK6 and FURIN to LPL leading to cleavage and dissociation of LPL from the cell surface; the function does not require ANGPTL3 proteolytic cleavage but seems to be mediated by the N-terminal domain, and is not inhibited by GPIHBP1 (PubMed:12097324, 19318355, 20581395). Can inhibit endothelial lipase, causing increased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipids (PubMed:17110602, 19028676). Can bind to adipocytes to activate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:12565906).

Cysteine protease that plays a key role in autophagy by mediating both proteolytic activation and delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:21177865, 29458288, 30661429). The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of ATG8 family proteins: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins MAP1LC3 and GABARAPL2, to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:21177865). Exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus is essential for ATG8 proteins conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy (By similarity). In addition to the protease activity, also mediates delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:29458288, 33909989).

CTH,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Catalyzes the last step in the trans-sulfuration pathway from L-methionine to L-cysteine in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent manner, which consists on cleaving the L,L-cystathionine molecule into L-cysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (PubMed:10212249, 19261609, 19961860, 18476726). Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, 19261609, 19961860, 19019829). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity).

Involved in cell migration via its interaction with intracellular domain of ROBO1, leading to regulate the Slit signaling. Plays a role in commissural axon guidance cross the ventral midline of the neural tube in a Slit-dependent manner, possibly by mediating the deubiquitination of ROBO1. Acts as a regulator of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating the deubiquitination of beta-arrestins (ARRB1 and ARRB2) and beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Plays a central role in ADRB2 recycling and resensitization after prolonged agonist stimulation by constitutively binding ADRB2, mediating deubiquitination of ADRB2 and inhibiting lysosomal trafficking of ADRB2. Upon dissociation, it is probably transferred to the translocated beta-arrestins, leading to beta-arrestins deubiquitination and disengagement from ADRB2. This suggests the existence of a dynamic exchange between the ADRB2 and beta-arrestins. Deubiquitinates DIO2, thereby regulating thyroid hormone regulation. Mediates deubiquitination of both 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains.

SELENOF,NCBI Gene Summary,"The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEP15/selenoprotein M family. The exact function of this protein is not known; however, it has been found to associate with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR), an endoplasmic reticulum(ER)-resident protein, which is involved in the quality control of protein folding. The association with UGTR retains this protein in the ER, where it may play a role in protein folding. It has also been suggested to have a role in cancer etiology. This protein is a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2016]"

Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:12962325, 19061985, 24120868, 23636399).

The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the peptidase T1A family, that is a 20S core alpha subunit. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]"

PSMA5,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex).

GNAI3,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state. Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding. The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal. Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:8774883, 18434541, 19478087). Signaling is mediated via effector proteins, such as adenylate cyclase. Inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to decreased intracellular cAMP levels (PubMed:19478087). Stimulates the activity of receptor-regulated K(+) channels (PubMed:2535845). The active GTP-bound form prevents the association of RGS14 with centrosomes and is required for the translocation of RGS14 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. May play a role in cell division (PubMed:17635935).

AHCYL1,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Multifaceted cellular regulator which coordinates several essential cellular functions including regulation of epithelial HCO3(-) and fluid secretion, mRNA processing and DNA replication. Regulates ITPR1 sensitivity to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, competing for the common binding site and acting as endogenous 'pseudoligand' whose inhibitory activity can be modulated by its phosphorylation status. Promotes the formation of contact points between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, facilitating transfer of Ca(2+) from the ER to mitochondria (PubMed:27995898). Under normal cellular conditions, functions cooperatively with BCL2L10 to limit ITPR1-mediated Ca(2+) release but, under apoptotic stress conditions, dephosphorylated which promotes dissociation of both AHCYL1 and BCL2L10 from mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, inhibits BCL2L10 interaction with ITPR1 and leads to increased Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:27995898). In the pancreatic and salivary ducts, at resting state, attenuates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release by interacting with ITPR1 (PubMed:16793548). When extracellular stimuli induce ITPR1 phosphorylation or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, dissociates from ITPR1 to interact with CFTR and SLC26A6, mediating their synergistic activation by calcium and cAMP that stimulates the epithelial secretion of electrolytes and fluid (By similarity). Also activates basolateral SLC4A4 isoform 1 to coordinate fluid and HCO3(-) secretion (PubMed:16769890). Inhibits the effect of STK39 on SLC4A4 and CFTR by recruiting PP1 phosphatase which activates SLC4A4, SLC26A6 and CFTR through dephosphorylation (By similarity). Mediates the induction of SLC9A3 surface expression produced by Angiotensin-2 (PubMed:20584908). Depending on the cell type, activates SLC9A3 in response to calcium or reverses SLC9A3R2-dependent calcium inhibition (PubMed:18829453). May modulate the polyadenylation state of specific mRNAs, both by controlling the subcellular location of FIP1L1 and by inhibiting PAPOLA activity, in response to a stimulus that alters its phosphorylation state (PubMed:19224921). Acts as a (dATP)-dependent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit RRM1, controlling the endogenous dNTP pool and ensuring normal cell cycle progression (PubMed:25237103). In vitro does not exhibit any S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase activity (By similarity).

Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, 30181260, 29107538, 29158492, 28935770). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:22980980, 30181260, 29158492).

KCNA2,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain and the central nervous system, but also in the cardiovascular system. Prevents aberrant action potential firing and regulates neuronal output. Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:19912772, 8495559, 11211111, 23769686). Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5, KCNA6, KCNA7, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (PubMed:8495559, 20220134). Channel properties are modulated by cytoplasmic beta subunits that regulate the subcellular location of the alpha subunits and promote rapid inactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels. In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member. Homotetrameric KCNA2 forms a delayed-rectifier potassium channel that opens in response to membrane depolarization, followed by slow spontaneous channel closure (PubMed:19912772, 23769686). In contrast, a heteromultimer formed by KCNA2 and KCNA4 shows rapid inactivation (PubMed:8495559). Regulates neuronal excitability and plays a role as pacemaker in the regulation of neuronal action potentials (By similarity). KCNA2-containing channels play a presynaptic role and prevent hyperexcitability and aberrant action potential firing (By similarity). Response to toxins that are selective for KCNA2-containing potassium channels suggests that in Purkinje cells, dendritic subthreshold KCNA2-containing potassium channels prevent random spontaneous calcium spikes, suppressing dendritic hyperexcitability without hindering the generation of somatic action potentials, and thereby play an important role in motor coordination (By similarity). Plays a role in the induction of long-term potentiation of neuron excitability in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus (By similarity). May function as down-stream effector for G protein-coupled receptors and inhibit GABAergic inputs to basolateral amygdala neurons (By similarity). May contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of the axonal release of the neurotransmitter dopamine (By similarity). Reduced KCNA2 expression plays a role in the perception of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury, but not acute pain (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of the time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (By similarity).

DDX20,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
The SMN complex catalyzes the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome, and thereby plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate. Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP. May also play a role in the metabolism of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNPs).

5'-3' exonuclease that plays a central role in telomere maintenance and protection during S-phase. Participates in the protection of telomeres against non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair, thereby ensuring that telomeres do not fuse. Plays a key role in telomeric loop (T loop) formation by being recruited by TERF2 at the leading end telomeres and by processing leading-end telomeres immediately after their replication via its exonuclease activity: generates 3' single-stranded overhang at the leading end telomeres avoiding blunt leading-end telomeres that are vulnerable to end-joining reactions and expose the telomere end in a manner that activates the DNA repair pathways. Together with TERF2, required to protect telomeres from replicative damage during replication by controlling the amount of DNA topoisomerase (TOP1, TOP2A and TOP2B) needed for telomere replication during fork passage and prevent aberrant telomere topology. Also involved in response to DNA damage: plays a role in response to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) by facilitating double-strand break formation. In case of spindle stress, involved in prophase checkpoint. Possesses beta-lactamase activity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of penicillin G and nitrocefin (PubMed:31434986). Exhibits no activity towards other beta-lactam antibiotic classes including cephalosporins (cefotaxime) and carbapenems (imipenem) (PubMed:31434986).

NOTCH2,NCBI Gene Summary,"This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type 1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined. This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell surface as a heterodimer. This protein functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands, and may play a role in vascular, renal and hepatic development. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]"

It is preferentially associated with mRNAs produced by splicing, including both nuclear mRNAs and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. It is thought that the protein remains associated with spliced mRNAs as a tag to indicate where introns had been present, thus coupling pre- and post-mRNA splicing events. Previously, it was thought that two genes encode this protein, RBM8A and RBM8B; it is now thought that the RBM8B locus is a pseudogene. There are two alternate translation start codons with this gene, which result in two forms of the protein. An allele mutation and a low-frequency noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this gene cause thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]"

RBM8A,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:28502770, 29301961). Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM1 leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm and translation enhancement of EJC-bearing spliced mRNAs by recruiting them to the ribosomal 48S preinitiation complex. Its removal from cytoplasmic mRNAs requires translation initiation from EJC-bearing spliced mRNAs. Associates preferentially with mRNAs produced by splicing. Does not interact with pre-mRNAs, introns, or mRNAs produced from intronless cDNAs. Associates with both nuclear mRNAs and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer is a component of the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the function is different from the established EJC assembly.

AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin. Beta non-catalytic subunit acts as a scaffold on which the AMPK complex assembles, via its C-terminus that bridges alpha (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2) and gamma subunits (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3).

ABCC8 is the regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, which is located on the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta cells and plays a key role in the control of insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. This protein is thought to be an endogenous regulator of KATP channels. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this protein modulates insulin secretion through the interaction with KATP channel, and this gene has been proposed as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. At least eight alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

PIP5K1A,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P/PI4P) to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2/PIP2), a lipid second messenger that regulates several cellular processes such as signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell motility (PubMed:8955136, 21477596, 22942276). PtdIns(4,5)P2 can directly act as a second messenger or can be utilized as a precursor to generate other second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PIP3) (PubMed:19158393, 20660631). PIP5K1A-mediated phosphorylation of PtdIns(4)P is the predominant pathway for PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis (By similarity). Can also use phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) as substrate in vitro (PubMed:22942276). Together with PIP5K1C, is required for phagocytosis, both enzymes regulating different types of actin remodeling at sequential steps (By similarity). Promotes particle ingestion by activating the WAS GTPase-binding protein that induces Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization at the nascent phagocytic cup (By similarity). Together with PIP5K1B, is required, after stimulation by G-protein coupled receptors, for the synthesis of IP3 that will induce stable platelet adhesion (By similarity). Recruited to the plasma membrane by the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex where it provides the substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 for the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, IP3 and DAG, that will mobilize internal calcium and drive keratinocyte differentiation (PubMed:19158393). Positively regulates insulin-induced translocation of SLC2A4 to the cell membrane in adipocytes (By similarity). Together with PIP5K1C has a role during embryogenesis (By similarity). Independently of its catalytic activity, is required for membrane ruffling formation, actin organization and focal adhesion formation during directional cell migration by controlling integrin-induced translocation of the small GTPase RAC1 to the plasma membrane (PubMed:20660631). Also functions in the nucleus where it acts as an activator of TUT1 adenylyltransferase activity in nuclear speckles, thereby regulating mRNA polyadenylation of a select set of mRNAs (PubMed:18288197).

S100A9 is a calcium- and zinc-binding protein which plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response (PubMed:12626582, 15331440, 20103766, 8423249, 16258195, 19122197, 21325622). It can induce neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, can increase the bactericidal activity of neutrophils by promoting phagocytosis via activation of SYK, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 and can induce degranulation of neutrophils by a MAPK-dependent mechanism (PubMed:12626582, 15331440, 20103766). Predominantly found as calprotectin (S100A8/A9) which has a wide plethora of intra- and extracellular functions (PubMed:8423249, 16258195, 19122197). The intracellular functions include: facilitating leukocyte arachidonic acid trafficking and metabolism, modulation of the tubulin-dependent cytoskeleton during migration of phagocytes and activation of the neutrophilic NADPH-oxidase (PubMed:15331440, 21325622). Activates NADPH-oxidase by facilitating the enzyme complex assembly at the cell membrane, transferring arachidonic acid, an essential cofactor, to the enzyme complex and S100A8 contributes to the enzyme assembly by directly binding to NCF2/P67PHOX (PubMed:15642721, 22808130). The extracellular functions involve pro-inflammatory, antimicrobial, oxidant-scavenging and apoptosis-inducing activities (PubMed:8423249, 19534726). Its pro-inflammatory activity includes recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of cytokine and chemokine production, and regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration (PubMed:15598812, 21487906). Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER) (PubMed:19402754). Binding to TLR4 and AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways resulting in the amplification of the pro-inflammatory cascade (PubMed:19402754, 22804476). Has antimicrobial activity towards bacteria and fungi and exerts its antimicrobial activity probably via chelation of Zn(2+) which is essential for microbial growth (PubMed:19087201). Can induce cell death via autophagy and apoptosis and this occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the process involves BNIP3 (PubMed:19935772). Can regulate neutrophil number and apoptosis by an anti-apoptotic effect; regulates cell survival via ITGAM/ITGB and TLR4 and a signaling mechanism involving MEK-ERK (PubMed:22363402). Its role as an oxidant scavenger has a protective role in preventing exaggerated tissue damage by scavenging oxidants (PubMed:22489132, 21912088). Can act as a potent amplifier of inflammation in autoimmunity as well as in cancer development and tumor spread (PubMed:16258195). Has transnitrosylase activity; in oxidatively-modified low-densitity lipoprotein (LDL(ox))-induced S-nitrosylation of GAPDH on 'Cys-247' proposed to transfer the NO moiety from NOS2/iNOS to GAPDH via its own S-nitrosylated Cys-3 (PubMed:25417112). The iNOS-S100A8/A9 transnitrosylase complex is proposed to also direct selective inflammatory stimulus-dependent S-nitrosylation of multiple targets such as ANXA5, EZR, MSN and VIM by recognizing a [IL]-x-C-x-x-[DE] motif (PubMed:25417112).

Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER). Binding to AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. Acts as a monocyte and mast cell chemoattractant. Can stimulate mast cell degranulation and activation which generates chemokines, histamine and cytokines inducing further leukocyte recruitment to the sites of inflammation. Can inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases; MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 by chelating Zn(2+) from their active sites. Possesses filariacidal and filariastatic activity.

That Rab is involved in endocytic recycling and regulates the transport to the plasma membrane of transmembrane proteins like the tight junction protein OCLN/occludin. Thereby, it regulates the assembly and the activity of tight junctions. Moreover, it may also regulate tight junction assembly by activating the PKA signaling pathway and by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of the downstream effectors PRKACA and MICALL2 respectively. Through its role in tight junction assembly, may play a role in the establishment of Sertoli cell barrier. Plays also a role in angiogenesis through regulation of endothelial cells chemotaxis.

Catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) referred to as A-to-I RNA editing (PubMed:7972084, 7565688, 12618436). This may affect gene expression and function in a number of ways that include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins since the translational machinery read the inosine as a guanosine; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by changing sequences involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by changing sequences during viral RNA replication; and RNA structure-dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein-RNA interactions. Can edit both viral and cellular RNAs and can edit RNAs at multiple sites (hyper-editing) or at specific sites (site-specific editing). Its cellular RNA substrates include: bladder cancer-associated protein (BLCAP), neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate (GRIA2) and serotonin (HTR2C) and GABA receptor (GABRA3). Site-specific RNA editing of transcripts encoding these proteins results in amino acid substitutions which consequently alters their functional activities. Exhibits low-level editing at the GRIA2 Q/R site, but edits efficiently at the R/G site and HOTSPOT1. Its viral RNA substrates include: hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus (MV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Exhibits either a proviral (HDV, MV, VSV and HIV-1) or an antiviral effect (HCV) and this can be editing-dependent (HDV and HCV), editing-independent (VSV and MV) or both (HIV-1). Impairs HCV replication via RNA editing at multiple sites. Enhances the replication of MV, VSV and HIV-1 through an editing-independent mechanism via suppression of EIF2AK2/PKR activation and function. Stimulates both the release and infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles by an editing-dependent mechanism where it associates with viral RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5'UTR and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Can enhance viral replication of HDV via A-to-I editing at a site designated as amber/W, thereby changing an UAG amber stop codon to an UIG tryptophan (W) codon that permits synthesis of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg) which has a key role in the assembly of viral particles. However, high levels of ADAR1 inhibit HDV replication.

Signaling adapter that couples activated growth factor receptors to signaling pathways. Participates in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Isoform p46Shc and isoform p52Shc, once phosphorylated, couple activated receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras via the recruitment of the GRB2/SOS complex and are implicated in the cytoplasmic propagation of mitogenic signals. Isoform p46Shc and isoform p52Shc may thus function as initiators of the Ras signaling cascade in various non-neuronal systems. Isoform p66Shc does not mediate Ras activation, but is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress and life span. Isoform p66Shc acts as a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is indispensable for the ability of stress-activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants, cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The expression of isoform p66Shc has been correlated with life span (By similarity).

Development of immature T-cell precursors (thymocytes) to either the CD4 helper or CD8 killer T-cell lineages correlates precisely with their T-cell receptor specificity for major histocompatibility complex class II or class I molecules, respectively. Cross-antagonism between ZBTB7B and CBF complexes are determinative to CD4 versus CD8 cell fate decision. Suppresses RUNX3 expression and imposes CD4+ lineage fate by inducing the SOCS suppressors of cytokine signaling. induces, as a transcriptional activator, SOCS genes expression which represses RUNX3 expression and promotes the CD4+ lineage fate. During CD4 lineage commitment, associates with multiple sites at the CD8 locus, acting as a negative regulator of the CD8 promoter and enhancers by epigenetic silencing through the recruitment of class II histone deacetylases, such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, to these loci.

Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that also participates in apoptotic pathways which are initiated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Fas ligand, and gamma interferon.

Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein which is more than twice the size of its E.coli counterpart (EcoL24). Sequence analysis identified two transcript variants that encode the same protein.

CD5L,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Secreted protein that acts as a key regulator of lipid synthesis: mainly expressed by macrophages in lymphoid and inflamed tissues and regulates mechanisms in inflammatory responses, such as infection or atherosclerosis. Able to inhibit lipid droplet size in adipocytes. Following incorporation into mature adipocytes via CD36-mediated endocytosis, associates with cytosolic FASN, inhibiting fatty acid synthase activity and leading to lipolysis, the degradation of triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). CD5L-induced lipolysis occurs with progression of obesity: participates in obesity-associated inflammation following recruitment of inflammatory macrophages into adipose tissues, a cause of insulin resistance and obesity-related metabolic disease. Regulation of intracellular lipids mediated by CD5L has a direct effect on transcription regulation mediated by nuclear receptors ROR-gamma (RORC). Acts as a key regulator of metabolic switch in T-helper Th17 cells. Regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Th17 cells by altering the lipid content and limiting synthesis of cholesterol ligand of RORC, the master transcription factor of Th17-cell differentiation. CD5L is mainly present in non-pathogenic Th17 cells, where it decreases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acyls (PUFA), affecting two metabolic proteins MSMO1 and CYP51A1, which synthesize ligands of RORC, limiting RORC activity and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Participates in obesity-associated autoimmunity via its association with IgM, interfering with the binding of IgM to Fcalpha/mu receptor and enhancing the development of long-lived plasma cells that produce high-affinity IgG autoantibodies (By similarity). Also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in macrophages: promotes macrophage survival from the apoptotic effects of oxidized lipids in case of atherosclerosis (PubMed:24295828). Involved in early response to microbial infection against various pathogens by acting as a pattern recognition receptor and by promoting autophagy (PubMed:16030018, 24223991, 24583716, 25713983).

The protein encoded by this gene localizes within Golgi compartments, endosomes, and lysosomes, and is cleaved into a stable soluble form. The soluble form is required for the intracellular processing of some glycolipids into a form that can be presented by other CD1 family members. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. Additional transcript variants have been found; however, their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]"

AIM2,UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary,"
Sensor component of the AIM2 inflammasome, which mediates inflammasome activation in response to the presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol, leading to subsequent pyroptosis (PubMed:17726700, 19158675, 19158676, 19158679, 20566831, 26197926, 29440442, 23530044, 26583071, 33980849). Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation (PubMed:17726700, 19158675, 19158676, 19158679, 20566831, 26197926, 29440442, 33980849). Acts as a recognition receptor (PRR): specifically recognizes and binds dsDNA in the cytosol, and mediates the formation of the inflammasome polymeric complex composed of AIM2, CASP1 and PYCARD/ASC (PubMed:17726700, 19158675, 19158676, 19158679, 20566831, 26197926, 29440442, 33980849). Recruitment of pro-caspase-1 (proCASP1) to the AIM2 inflammasome promotes caspase-1 (CASP1) activation, which subsequently cleaves and activates inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IL18 and gasdermin-D (GSDMD), promoting cytokine secretion (PubMed:17726700, 19158675, 19158676, 19158679, 20566831). In some cells, CASP1 activation mediates cleavage and activation of GSDMD, triggering pyroptosis without promoting cytokine secretion (PubMed:19158675, 19158676). Detects cytosolic dsDNA of viral and bacterial origin in a non-sequence-specific manner (PubMed:17726700, 19158675, 19158676, 19158679, 20566831, 26197926, 29440442, 26583071, 33980849). Involved in the DNA damage response caused by acute ionizing radiation by mediating pyroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks (By similarity). Mechanistically, AIM2 senses DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome assembly and inflammatory cell death (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of neurodevelopment via its role in the DNA damage response: acts by promoting neural cell death in response to DNA damage in the developing brain, thereby purging genetically compromised cells of the central nervous system (By similarity). Pyroptosis mediated by the AIM2 inflammasome in response to DNA damage is dependent on GSDMD without involving IL1B and IL18 cytokine secretion (By similarity). Also acts as a mediator of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis (PANoptosis), an integral part of host defense against pathogens, in response to bacterial infection (By similarity). Can also trigger PYCARD/ASC-dependent, caspase-1-independent cell death that involves caspase-8 (CASP8) (By similarity).

Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Has a promiscuous chemokine-binding profile, interacting with inflammatory chemokines of both the CXC and the CC subfamilies but not with homeostatic chemokines. Acts as a receptor for chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL14, CCL17, CXCL5, CXCL6, IL8/CXCL8, CXCL11, GRO, RANTES, MCP-1, TARC and also for the malaria parasites P.vivax and P.knowlesi. May regulate chemokine bioavailability and, consequently, leukocyte recruitment through two distinct mechanisms: when expressed in endothelial cells, it sustains the abluminal to luminal transcytosis of tissue-derived chemokines and their subsequent presentation to circulating leukocytes; when expressed in erythrocytes, serves as blood reservoir of cognate chemokines but also as a chemokine sink, buffering potential surges in plasma chemokine levels.

Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. Triggers cytolytic activity only in natural killer cells (NK) expressing high surface densities of natural cytotoxicity receptors (PubMed:11489943, 16920955). Positive signaling in NK cells implicates phosphorylation of VAV1. NK cell activation seems to depend on SH2D1B and not on SH2D1A (PubMed:16920955).

Self-ligand receptor of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family. SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. SLAMF1-induced signal-transduction events in T-lymphocytes are different from those in B-cells. Two modes of SLAMF1 signaling seem to exist: one depending on SH2D1A (and perhaps SH2D1B) and another in which protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2C (PTPN11)-dependent signal transduction operates. Initially it has been proposed that association with SH2D1A prevents binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:11806999). However, signaling is also regulated by SH2D1A which can simultaneously interact with and recruit FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1 (PubMed:12458214). Mediates IL-2-independent proliferation of activated T-cells during immune responses and induces IFN-gamma production (By similarity). Downstreaming signaling involves INPP5D, DOK1 and DOK2 leading to inhibited IFN-gamma production in T-cells, and PRKCQ, BCL10 and NFKB1 leading to increased T-cell activation and Th2 cytokine production (By similarity).

Acts as costimulator in NK activation by enhancing signals by other NK receptors such as NCR3 and NCR1 (PubMed:10741393). At early stages of NK cell differentiation may function as an inhibitory receptor possibly ensuring the self-tolerance of developing NK cells (PubMed:11917118). Involved in the regulation of CD8(+) T-cell proliferation; expression on activated T-cells and binding to CD48 provides costimulatory-like function for neighboring T-cells (By similarity). Inhibits inflammatory responses in dendritic cells (DCs) (By similarity).
